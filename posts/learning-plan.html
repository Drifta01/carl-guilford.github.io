        "Reflection is the most important part of the learning process. We do
         not learn from experience... we learn from reflecting on experience."

        "Reflecting is a crucial part of the learning process. By reflecting on
        what you have done, you strengthen your awareness of your meta-cognitive
        processes and build a sense of responsibility for your learning.<br />
       
        Until recently, the conventional thinking was that our brains were wired
        at birth and therefore unchangeable. In actuality, our brains are like
        malleable plastic that is constantly being reshaped by our daily
        experiences."<i><u>Dev Academy</u></i>

        "Reflection is the most important part of the learning process. We do
        not learn from experience... we learn from reflecting on experience."
      </h3>

      <h3 class="lp-h4"></h3>

      "Reflecting is a crucial part of the learning process. By reflecting on
      what you have done, you strengthen your awareness of your meta-cognitive
      processes and build a sense of responsibility for your learning. Until
      recently, the conventional thinking was that our brains were wired at
      birth and therefore unchangeable. In actuality, our brains are like
      malleable plastic that is constantly being reshaped by our daily
      experiences."<br />

        my strengths would be innovation and willingness to always learn more,
        my limitations are both physical and mental. my mobility is heavily
        restricted these days. i do have a hard time explaining what i have
        learned, i think understand all iv'e been learning but sometimes when im
        asked to describe what iv'e learned i just can't find the words to
        explain it.

        my expectations from the facilitation team is to do there best at trying
        to help me acheive my goals, no'one is expecting miracles i think we all
        get out of this as to what we put in.

        understanding of my goals and is helping me while i go through this
        course. all of my commitments are now easily acheived.
